[RS232Work](https://medo64.com/rs232work/)
==========================================

This Framework laptop expansion card will show up on your system as a serial
device and allow for a serial RS-232 communication up to 115,200 baud rate.


## RS-232 Pinout

| # | Ref | Description                     | Wire color |
|--:|-----|---------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | GND | Ground connection               | Black      |
| 2 | RXD | Receive (RS-232)                | Yellow     |
| 3 | TXD | Transmit (RS-232)               | Orange     |

PS: Colors are just a suggestion and it's not necessary to have them match the
table.


### Wiring

To connect to this board, one has to use 3-pin JST XH connector. The following
table represents the pinout, pin 1 being on the left as looking into the
expansion card.

As power consumption is below 10 mA, wires can be almost any AWG. I would
recommend using 24 AWG wire 0.25 mmÂ² as they allow for greater compatibility
with other connectors.
